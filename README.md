# AdaSearch: Balancing Parametric Knowledge and Search in Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning

**AdaSearch** is a two-stage inference and reinforcement learning framework for LLM-based search agents, which disentangles search-invocation decision-making from problem solving and optimizes them independently.

Compared to prior work, AdaSearch selectively invokes search, provides transparent decision rationales for user auditing, and achieves stronger self-knowledge awareness, while preserving QA performance.
